We've all seen the Google homepage on our computers when we're surfing the web.Here I have created same by using basic HTML and CSS.
# HTML
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our Google search page clone.

The document includes several elements such as the <!DOCTYPE HTML> declaration, which specifies the version of HTML being used, and the <html> 
tags which define the start and end of the document. The <head> section includes metadata about the document such as the title, character encoding, 
and links to external files such as a CSS file with the href attribute.

The <body> section includes the visible content of the web page, which can include various elements such as headings, 
paragraphs, images, links, and more. The code snippet also includes a <header> element, which is a section that typically 
appears at the top of the page and can include branding, navigation links, and other content.

The <ul> element is an unordered list, which contains a series of <li> elements that define each item in the list. 
In this case, the list is part of the top bar and includes links to Gmail and Images. The code also includes an SVG graphic
with the path elements that define the shape of the image.

Overall, HTML provides a structured way to organize and present content on the web, and this example illustrates some
of the basic building blocks of an HTML document.
# CSS
CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.

Next, we will create our CSS file. In this file, we will use some basic CSS rules to create our Google search page clone. 
We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.

This will give our Google search page clone an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.
css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.
